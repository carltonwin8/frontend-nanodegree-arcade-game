## User Instructions

One can run this game by clicking on the link
[here](https://carltonwin8.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game).

 - The objective is to move the character from the grass, across the stones
   and then to the water, without getting hit by the bugs running across
   the stones.
 - If the character gets to the water, the game is restarted and the character
   is placed at a random location on the grass area.
 - If the character is hit by a bug, the game is restarted and the character
   is placed at a random location on the grass area.
 - When the bug is crossing over the line between two stones, if the character
   steps on either stone, the game is restarted and the character
   is placed at a random location on the grass area.
